Third Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX
## Description

This was the third challenge for the University of Birmingham bootcamp in front-end web-developing and UX. In this challenge, I had to build a portfolio using Bootstrap to showcase my projects and use it as a tool when ready to look for a job in tech.  

Guidelines for successful completition of this challenge included making sure that when the page is loaded it presents my name, recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, skills and how to contact me. The page had to be responsive, resizing when viewed with different devices and had to contain a jumbatron, a navbar and footer. 

This challenge reinforced everything we learnt about Bootstrap and responsive design. I encountered a few hiccups along the way, but with a little reserch everything came together in the end. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a simple portfolio webpage. All you need to do is open the webpage with your browser. The navigation bar has clickable links that take you to each of the main sections of the page.
The section showcasing my projects is under construction and eventually will have clickable images which will link to the live projects for now they are linking to the same. The contact me section, currently links to instagram, twitter and facebook, with place holders for phone number, and email.
